/*
 * A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:
        Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided.
                   Additional minutes are $0.45 per minute.
        Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided.
                   Additional minutes are $0.40 per minute.
        Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.

    Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill.
    It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used.

    It should then display the total amount due.

    Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C.
