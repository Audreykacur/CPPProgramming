Why Programming?
Computer - Programmable machine designed to follow instructions 

Program - Instructions in computer memory to make it do something 

Programmer - person who writes instructions (Programs) to make computer perform a task 


Main Hardware Component Categories: 
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2. Main Memory
3. Secondary Memory/ Storage
4. Input Devices
5. Output 

Centeral Processing Unit (CPU)
Compromisedd of: 
	Control Unit - retrives and decodes program instructions 
				 - Coordinates activities of all other parts of computer 
	Arithmetic & Logic Unit - Hardware optimized for high speed numeric calculation, Hardware designed for true false, yes/no decisions


Programs and Programming languages 
- a program is a set of instrucation that the computer follows to perform a task
- we start with an algorithm, which is a set of well-defined steps



How to come up with an algorithm 
1. What data do we need to complete the problem 
2. 


Machine Language 
- instructions are binary numbers such as 1001
- rather than writing programs in machine language, programmers use programming languages 

Programs and programming languages 
- types of languages
	- low level : used for communication with computer hardware directly. Often writeen in binary machine code (0's and 1's) directly
	- high level : closer to human language


From a High Level Program to an Executable File
