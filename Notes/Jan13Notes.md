Why Programming?
Computer - Programmable machine designed to follow instructions 

Program - Instructions in computer memory to make it do something 

Programmer - Person who writes instructions (Programs) to make the computer perform a task 


Main Hardware Component Categories: 
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2. Main Memory
3. Secondary Memory/ Storage
4. Input Devices
5. Output 

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
Compromised of: 
	Control Unit - retrieves and decodes program instructions 
				 - Coordinates activities of all other parts of the computer 
	Arithmetic & Logic Unit - Hardware optimized for high-speed numeric calculation, Hardware designed for true-false, yes/no decisions


Programs and Programming languages 
- A program is a set of instructions that the computer follows to perform a task
- We start with an algorithm, which is a set of well-defined steps


Machine Language 
- Instructions are binary numbers such as 1001
- Rather than writing programs in machine language, programmers use programming languages 

Programs and programming languages 
- Types of languages
	- low level: used for communication with computer hardware directly. Often written in binary machine code (0's and 1's) directly
	- high level: closer to human language


From a High-Level Program to an Executable File
1. Create a file containing the program with a text editor
2. Run preprocessor to convert source file directives to source code program statements 
3. Run compiler to convert source program into machine instructions 
4. Run linker to connect hardware-specific code to machine instructions, producing an executable file 
	- steps b - d are ofter performed by a single command or button click 
	- Errors detected at any step will prevent the execution of the following steps 
Source code -> Preprocessor -> Modified Source Code -> Compiler -> Object code -> Linker -> Executable code

source code - is entered with a text editor by the programmer 

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- an integrated development environment, or IDE, combine all the tools needed to write, compile, and debug a program into a single software application
- examples: Microsoft, Visual Studio, code blocks, turbo c++ explorer, CodeWarrior

What is a program made of
- common elements in a programming language
	- Keywords
	- Programmer - Defined Identifiers
	- Operators
	- Punctuation
	- Syntax

Keywords
- aka reserved words
- have a special meaning in C++
- can not be used for any other purpose
- ex. using, namespace, int, return

Programmer-Defined Identifiers
- Names made up by the programmer
- Not part of the C++ language
- Used to represent various things: variables (Memory locations), functions, etc

Operators 
- Used to perform operations on data
- Many types of operators: Arithmetic ex. + - :: Assignment ex. = 
- Some operators (>> and << and =)

Syntax
- the rules of grammar that must be followed when writing a program 
- controls the use of keywords, operators, programmer-defined symbols, and punctuation 

Variables 
- variable: a named storage location in the computer's memory for holding a place of data 
- ex. hours might hold the number of hours worked 

Variable Definition
- to create a variable in a program, you must write a variable definition (also called a variable declaration) (ex., double hours)
1.5
Input, Processing, and Output
- three steps that a program typically performs:
	1. Gather input data
		- from keyboards
		- from files on disk drives
	2. Process the input data
	3. Display the results as output
		- Send it to the screen
		- write to a file 
1.6
Programming Process
1. Clearly define what the program is to do
2. Visualize the program running on the computer
3. Use design tools such as a hierarchy chart, flowcharts, or pseudocode to create a model of the program
4. Check the model for logical errors
5. Type the code, save it, and compile it
6. Correct any errors found during compilation. Repeat steps 5 and 6 as many times as necessary 
7. Run the program with the test data for input
8. Correct any errors found while running the program. Repeat steps 5 through 8 as many times as necessary 
9. Validate the results of the program
